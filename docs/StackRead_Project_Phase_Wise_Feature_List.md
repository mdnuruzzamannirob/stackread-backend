## True MVP — What You Need to Launch (Phase 2 MUST only)

This is the absolute minimum that makes ReadVault a working, sellable product:

**Guest**
Browse catalogue → search → view title detail → read sample → see pricing → register → login

**Reader**
Subscribe (Stripe) → browse → borrow → read in-browser (eBook + audiobook) → place hold → write review → manage account

**Author**
Register → upload EPUB/PDF/MP3 → set DRM + access limits → submit for review → see basic read stats → receive royalties

**Admin**
Approve/reject uploads → manage users → configure subscription plans → view basic metrics dashboard → handle GDPR requests → audit log

**PWA**
Everything above works on mobile browser and is installable on home screen.

**That's it. Everything else is post-launch.**
