 * Migration: Drop compound multikey index on Book.authorIds and Book.categoryIds
 *
 * MongoDB does not allow compound indexes on multiple array fields (multikey fields).
 * This migration removes any existing compound index that was previously created.
 * New separate single-field indexes on authorIds and categoryIds will be created
 * automatically by Mongoose when the model is loaded.
